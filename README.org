~(mapconcat FUNCTION SEQUENCE SEPARATOR)~

Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE, and concat the results as strings.
In between each pair of results, stick in SEPARATOR.  Thus, " " as
SEPARATOR results in spaces between the values returned by FUNCTION.
SEQUENCE may be a list, a vector, a bool-vector, or a string.

** ~member~

~(member ELT LIST)~

For more information check the manuals.

Return non-nil if ELT is an element of LIST.  Comparison done with ‘equal’.
The value is actually the tail of LIST whose car is ELT.
